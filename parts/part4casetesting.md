# Aussie Building Corne - Part 4 - Case & Testing

## Case

The Corne V3 kit did come with a basic, sandwich case (acrylic base, FR4 mid plate, brass standoffs and rd bumpers for feet) which would be fine for the first few days but I really wanted to get a 3D printed case with tenting options.

I was fairly confident in my soldering work and went straight ahead into assembling the case. I would not suggest doing this for a reason I mention later. I would first get QMK setup and flash a default keymap.

Earlier when I was doing my research about the Corne I had come across a video by EIGA ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlZPnh9cbQU)) that showed what I thought was a very aestheticly pleasing and practical design for such a case so I started the hunt for an STL. Eventually I found it [here](https://www.printables.com/model/347524-corne-keyboard-case-5-and-6-columns) and found a local guy that I entrusted with the printing, in black PLA with 100% infill. A big thanks to [Too Easy 3D](tooeasy3d.wordpress.com) for doing this for me as I couldn't have asked for a better result. In fact, at the moment he's tweaking the model for me to improve the access to the connections and buttons via the cutouts.

Something that I particularly enjoyed about this particular case was the flexible and cheap tenting options. By utilising different length M5 bolts and nuts captured by the case, you are able to adjust the tenting to exactly what you wanted. I thought what better material to compliment the silver standoff screws and silver solder joints than stainless steel. So I went to my local fastener shop and purchased 4 or 5 different length stainless steel button head bolts (4 of each) and 8x nuts. I decided against using nylocs as suggested because I wanted to be able to remove them by hand to adjust. And this is the end result:
